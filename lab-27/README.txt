Lab 27 â€“ Building a Simple React Application with Routing and Components

This project includes:
- Basic routing using React Router.
- Three top-level routes: Home, About, Dashboard.
- A nested component structure under Dashboard:
  - UserStats.js
  - RecentActivity.js

Instructions:
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to view the app at http://localhost:3000.

Ensure React Router is installed:
  npm install react-router-dom
